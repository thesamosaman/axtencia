      <h1>Health Equity and Social Impact</h1>
      <p><strong>Advancing access, fairness, and measurable results.</strong></p>
      <p>
        Every policy, program, and initiative has an impact on different populations. 
        At Axtencia, we help organizations ensure that their work improves access and outcomes 
        for all groups in ways that are data-driven, practical, and fully compliant with federal requirements. 
        Our focus is on using evidence to identify disparities, remove barriers, and improve performance 
        across diverse communities without departing from regulatory guidance.
      </p>
      <p>
        We frame this work as part of good governance and program accountability: understanding who is reached, 
        who is left out, and how outcomes vary across populations. By doing so, we help organizations meet the intent 
        of federal Executive Orders, agency guidance, and program statutes while strengthening credibility with funders, 
        policymakers, and the public.
      </p>
